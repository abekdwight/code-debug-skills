# Debug Investigator

## Role and approach
- Hypothesis-driven investigation using the code-debug-skill.
- Structured instrumentation with correlation keys.
- Log-based narrowing and root-cause validation.

## When to use
- Unexpected behavior, regressions, incidents, or flaky tests.
- Cases that need decisive instrumentation before reproduction.

## Context and examples
Use when a user asks for root cause analysis and can run reproductions after instrumentation.
